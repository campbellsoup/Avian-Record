# Avian-Record
Code School project - Summer 2015

What is the App?

  This application has 3 primary functions for a registered User.
  
    1) Maintain their aviary Inventory(birds).  Both aquired birds and produced offspring.
    
    2) Manage Breeding pairs by accessing the database to calculate "Co-Efficient of Relations", persistent notes and       calculating possible outcomes for pairs with unique color mutations.
    
    3) Provide a Record log for active clutches per pair.  This function will hold temporary data recorded on nestbox checks until the clutch is pulled.  At which point the clutch log would collapse into select persistant-data, stored permanently with the pair.  User could add information or data as a note to the persistant-data.


Who would use it?

  Initial development is focused on Avian Record keeping.  Aviculturists working with any range of birds.
  New Owners of a bird could access limited data on the history of their bird so long as they are also a member.



Why and Expansion possibilities:

  This design could be modified to meet many different breeding programs.  The Application's intention is to maintain a healthy population of the species you are working with.  A healthy population can be extremely supported by having data about species and individual birds, where they came from, what is the pedigree, and suggest optimal "future pairings" to support outcrossing reproduction without hybridizing species.
  
  There are unique situations where species are struggling in the wild and/or captive populations.  This application could help identify other aviculturists working with the same species. In the current circumstances, it is very difficult to track blood lines, origins, and other aviculturists working with specific species. The result could be as defined as a recovery project where many individuals can support each other.  Or a tool to find new bloodlines to support outcrossing generations for healthier gene pools.
  
  
  Exotic:
  
    There are many exocit uses for this application beyond the avian world, including all areas of reptiles and other pets.
    
  Domesticated:
  
    This application could be easily modified for ranchers, farmers, or breeders of any livestock.  Something comparable would be stud bookkeepers in the horse industry.  However, this process is still paper based and this is the case in other areas where records are kept.  This application could potentially replace or be adopted by the AKC registery for dogs.
